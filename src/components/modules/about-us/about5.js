                                        Udemy has a refund policy, through which, if you are unsatisfied, you can ask for a refund within 30 days. To refund what you paid on Udemy, you need to go through the refund requesting processes on their site.

                                        For VIP courses requested through our website, the student can ask to stop the lectures at any time, and can refund the full amount for the lectures they did not take yet. The fees paid for lectures that are already given cannot be refunded. Simply let your instructor know that you do not want to complete the course, and we will refund you the suitable amount of what you paid, after deducting the frees for the lectures you already had.
